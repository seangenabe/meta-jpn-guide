# iKnow! Core 6000

* This anecdotal evidence has been perpetuated in the [LearnJapanese subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/search/?q=core%206000%20iknow%20license&restrict_sr=1):
  * Anecdotal: The learning material **[Japanese Core 6000](https://iknow.jp/content/japanese)** from the learning website *iKnow!* ([iknow.jp](https://iknow.jp)) has been released under the Creative Commons license.
  * Anecdotal: iKnow has since tried to rescind the Creative Commons license from the content, but due to the open nature of the Creative Commons license, this is not legally possible.
  * Anecdotal: The stock photos that allegedly came with the Japanese Core 6000 content are properly covered by copyright and are **not** licensed under a Creative Commons license.
