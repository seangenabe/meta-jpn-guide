# The Runner

The runner wants to get things done. They are willing to skip steps in order to reach their destination.

This route foregoes being able to speak Japanese in order to be able to "read" and understand it as early as possible.

## Learning kanji without readings

The base resource for this purpose is [Remembering the Kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji_and_Remembering_the_Hanzi) ("RtK") by James Heisig. While revolutionary when it's first published, it has a few criticisms:

- It's a book. Supplemental resources may be necessary to get the most out of it.
- As the book derives complex kanji from simpler kanji, it necessitates definition of these simpler kanji even if they are less useful.

* [Reviewing the Kanji](http://kanji.koohii.com/) ("Kanji Koohii") - An online resource to supplement / replace kanji learning. It features [spaced repetition](/sage/spaced-repetition/) and community mnemonics among others.
